\# Ship Refrigeration Digital Twin – Research Prototype



\## Overview

This repository contains a research prototype developed to explore the use of

Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs) for Digital Twin reasoning

in maritime systems.



The prototype focuses on a shipboard provision refrigeration plant

(meat, fish, and vegetable rooms) and demonstrates how unstructured

technical manuals can be transformed into a structured Knowledge Graph

to support system-level reasoning.



\## Key Features

\- Knowledge Graph representation of a ship refrigeration system

\- Deterministic reasoning for safety-critical control logic

\- Natural Language interface for querying system behavior

\- Explicit separation between structural reasoning and physical explanations

\- Safe handling of unsupported queries (no hallucination)



\## Scope and Limitations

\- The model captures selected components and control relationships

\- Failure modes and sub-component physics are not exhaustively modeled

\- The system is intended as a research demonstrator, not a production tool



\## Research Motivation

This project was developed as preparation for doctoral research in

Digital Twins, Knowledge Graphs, and trustworthy AI for maritime applications.



\## Status

Finalized and frozen as a validated research prototype.
